This project is a simple application skeleton for a NodeJs web app with PugJs templating. You can use it to quickly bootstrap your NodeJs web app projects and dev environment for these projects.


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the `nodejs-pug-starter` repository and install the dependencies:

### Clone `nodejs-pug-starter`

Clone the `nodejs-pug-starter` repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/abdulaz1z/nodejs-pug-starter.git
cd nodejs-pug-starter
```

If you just want to start a new project without the `nodejs-pug-starter` commit history then you can do:

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/abdulaz1z/nodejs-pug-starter.git <your-project-name>
```

The `depth=1` tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data.

### Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
node server.js
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:3000/.`](http://localhost:3000/)
